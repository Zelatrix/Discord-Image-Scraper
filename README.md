# Discord-Image-Scraper
A simple Python script that retrieves all the images from the HTML version of a Discord chat. This script runs on the command line, and the file location is intended to be passed as a command line parameter. An example usage of the tool is shown in the following code snippet: 

```
python image_crawler.py <filename>
```

If the file is stored in a directory other than the default command line directory, you must navigate to this directory first before running the tool.
